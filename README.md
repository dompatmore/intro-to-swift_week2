For this task, you will need to create a Command Line Tool Project.

To help you get used to working with Swift, I'd like you to have a go at the following.

1. Create a dictionary that models our class. Each 'object' in the dictionary should have a String for the first name, a String for the second name, and a one-letter string for role (S for Student, L for Lecturer). Manually populate it with the members of this class. If you want, you can make the secondName optional.
2. Using a for-loop or otherwise, for each object in the dictionary created in (1) make the output read ``<firstname>,<lastname>, <role>``
3. Create a function that will return the first lecturer in the class.
4. Create a function that takes in a name, and if found, returns wether the student is a lecturer or a student. If nothing is found, the program should print "Not Found"
5. Create a function that will loop through the list, but print the last name first. How do you think you could so the results by last name?
